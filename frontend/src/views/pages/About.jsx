                                    We are two students from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at KUET, 
                                    and we have developed this website to support and empower the agricultural community.

                                    Our goal is to bridge the digital gap in farming by offering practical tools such as 
                                    AI-powered plant disease detection, an interactive blogging/forum system, and instant 
                                    Bengali-language chatbot assistance â€” all in a farmer-friendly, accessible platform.
