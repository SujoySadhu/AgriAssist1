# Plant Disease Detection with Gemini AI Integration

This module now includes integration with Google's Gemini AI to provide detailed disease descriptions and treatment remedies.

## Features Added

1. **Disease Information**: When a disease is detected, the system now provides:
   - Detailed description of the disease
   - Symptoms and causes
   - Treatment remedies (both organic and chemical options)
   - Prevention strategies

2. **Healthy Plant Care**: For healthy plants, the system provides:
   - General care information
   - Optimal growing conditions
   - Watering and sunlight requirements
   - Fertilization tips

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Gemini API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the generated API key

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Add your Gemini API key to your `.env` file in the backend directory:

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

The required dependencies are already included in `requirements.txt`:
- `google-generativeai`
- `python-dotenv`

### 4. Test the Integration

Run the test script to verify the Gemini integration:

```bash
cd AgriAssist1/backend
python plant_disease/test_gemini.py
```

## API Response Format

The disease detection API now returns additional information:

```json
{
  "plant_name": "Tomato",
  "disease_name": "Early blight",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "is_healthy": false,
  "top_3_predictions": {...},
  "additional_info": {
    "description": "Early blight is a fungal disease that affects tomato plants...",
    "remedies": [
      "Remove and destroy infected leaves",
      "Apply fungicide treatment",
      "Improve air circulation around plants"
    ]
  }
}
```

For healthy plants:

```json
{
  "plant_name": "Tomato",
  "disease_name": "healthy",
  "confidence": 0.98,
  "is_healthy": true,
  "top_3_predictions": {...},
  "additional_info": {
    "description": "Your tomato plant appears to be healthy...",
    "care_tips": [
      "Water consistently at the base of the plant",
      "Provide 6-8 hours of sunlight daily",
      "Fertilize with balanced nutrients"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Frontend Integration

The frontend has been updated to display:
- Disease descriptions and remedies for affected plants
- Care tips for healthy plants
- Improved UI with icons and better formatting

## Error Handling

The system includes robust error handling:
- Graceful fallback if API key is not configured
- Error messages if Gemini API is unavailable
- JSON parsing fallbacks for malformed responses

## Security Notes

- Never commit your API key to version control
- The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore`
- API keys are loaded from environment variables only

## Troubleshooting

1. **"API key not configured" error**: Make sure your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is set in the `.env` file
2. **"Error retrieving information"**: Check your internet connection and API key validity
3. **Empty responses**: Verify the Gemini API is accessible from your server

## Cost Considerations

- Gemini API has usage limits and costs
- Monitor your API usage in Google AI Studio
- Consider implementing caching for frequently requested diseases
